### Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!

Hey there! I am a Flatiron School Alumni itching to break into the industry with my first junior software engineer role and grow within this awesome industry. I am looking forward to connecting with you!

Here is a bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a freelance website for the Snowy Mountain Trout Unlimited Chapter to help raise awareness of the chapter's conservation efforts, as well as assist in growing membership and donations! (Save the trout! They're awesome fish!)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Styled Components, Data Structures and Algorithms to improve my backend functionality, and system design using Amazon Web Services. In the future, I plan on exploring Mobile Development with both React Native and Kotlin/Swift. Mobile development is what got me interested into this field, so I want to get back to it!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that directly impact the lives of every day people in a positive way, particularly in either the healthcare or fintech space!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with system design using Amazon Web Services.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any sort of outdoor related activity. I am a huge outdoorsman with a dual passion for technology and nature!
